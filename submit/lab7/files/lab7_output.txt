in the f.c the function is referencing any variable to have a value -0.0. The function does not define which variable in main.c and as a result by calling the function the memory address of the both x and y in main.c overflow. Moreover, f.c takes in double data type whereas in main.c we are calling the function with integer.

testvec-static:
address of
main : 0x401bf6
